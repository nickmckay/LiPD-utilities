    "## How to: Python Pickle Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Python pickle files (\".p\") are an easy way to pass data to other users. A pickle file will store serialized data, and then deserialize when \"un-pickling\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with the Matlab or R scientific languages, this is similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* .Rdata files\n",
    "* .mat files\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some caveats to note before diving into the pickle module with LiPD utilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python object:\n",
    "An object may hold data and specific functions that can be used on that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionary:\n",
    "A set of data that is organized in key-values pairs, where the key is a unique identifier, and the value is any data type. A dictionary type is most similar to: JSON data, Matlab containers.Map, and R named lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LiPD Utilities and Backwards Compatability\n",
    "LiPD utilities are developed for Python 3.4+. As such, python objects that originated in a v3.4+ environment often cannot translate back to v2.7. Many base modules and third-party modules have changed since v2.7.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving data between Python versions can be messy because of these major differences. Pickle options are limited when Python 2.7 is involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Python 3.4+ -> Python 3.4+\n",
    "Data types: object, dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "All options available. This is the native Python version of LiPD utilities. Data will be loaded into the workspace global environment or set to a user-specified variable in the same manner that it was saved originally.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Python 3 <-> Python 2.7\n",
    "Data types: dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can only be loaded or saved as a dictionary data type. Objects will not translate correctly between versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Python 2.7 -> Python 2.7\n",
    "Data types: dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can only be loaded and saved as a dictionary data type. LiPD utilities cannot be used in v2.7, therefore LiPD objects are unavailable.\n",
